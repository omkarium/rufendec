|  Most file encryption programs are destructive in nature. You MUST know what you are doing.                                 |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  Before you encrypt files, kindly take this as a strict caution and don't forget to take a backup of your files.            |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  ================                                                                                                           |
|  $    Rules     $                                                                                                           |
|  ================                                                                                                           |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  1. Make sure you are not trying to decrypt unencrypted files or encrypt already encrypted files.                           |
|     Avoid using too many threads while processing large files. For example, say you have 10 files of each                   |
|     1 GB and you are using 10 threads at once, then 10 GB of memory could be consumed.                                      |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  2. It is recommended to not encrypt utf-8 incompatible files, for example binary files/executables.                        |
|     It will either create or skip such files, but ensure you don't try to encrypt anything as                               |
|     such in the first place. If done so, the later you decrypt them, the binaries may or may not work.                      |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  3. If you have encrypted files with --mode=gcm, and you tried to decrypt with --mode=ecb,                                  |
|     then the program will generate your decrypted target files, but those files WILL get                                    |
|     corrupted by getting filled with gibberish.                                                                             |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  4. If you have characters other than Alphanumeric (spaces are fine) in your folder and file names,                         |
|     then do not use them with this program. The program does not refuse to work with them,                                  |
|     but your files will be misplaced in weird locations because you had weird characters in your file and folder names.     |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  5. If you did not specify a target directory, then make sure you don't halt the program while its running.                 |
|     Allow the operation to fully complete.                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                                             |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  Ensure you provide the correct files for the operation you choose. Do some dummy tests before using on important files     |
|                                                                                                                             |
|  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                                             |
